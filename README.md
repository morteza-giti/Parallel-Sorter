# Parallel Sorting Algorithm in C#

This repository contains a parallel sorting algorithm implemented in C#. The algorithm demonstrates a significant improvement in performance, especially for a large number of items, compared to the standard non-parallel sorting algorithms.

## Algorithm Overview

The algorithm leverages parallel processing to efficiently sort a collection of integers. It utilizes multiple threads to divide the workload and merge the results concurrently, leading to faster sorting for large datasets.

## Features

- Parallel sorting of integers using C#
- Multi-threaded approach for faster performance
- Efficient merging of sorted sub-arrays

## Performance Comparison

The algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional non-parallel sorting algorithms, especially when dealing with a large number of items.

### Performance Metrics

- Normal Sorting: Average execution time for traditional sorting
- Parallel Sorting: Average execution time for parallel sorting
